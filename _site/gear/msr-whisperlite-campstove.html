<p>I tried on quite a few bags before landing on this pack and I’m quite happy with my decision. When we first began trying on bags we took a trip down to MEC. I tried on a few brands, including their MEC bags, a Black Diamond bag and a Deuter bag. None of the bags fit me right, either hitting me awkwardly at the hips or gaping far from my lower back.</p>

<p>When I got home I did some research on how to fit a bag. The first recommendation that I came across was to measure the length of your torso. I grabbed a tape measure and realized I have an incredibly short torso (less than 15 inches)! This is on the small size for women’s bags so I had to make sure the brand of bag I purchased had a women’s XS.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Wide opening at the top</li>
  <li>Mesh elastic pocket at the front for quick grab-and-go items</li>
  <li>Side entry zipper – makes it so much easier so you don’t have to open your bag every time</li>
  <li>Lower zippered bottom section that can be sectioned off (great for wet clothes &amp; gear)</li>
  <li>Inward synching hip belt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Top pocket is quite large. I found if you packed it too full it would push my head forward while hiking.</li>
  <li>Shoulder straps could have tightened a little more. They fit me perfectly fully tightened but I’m worried they may stretch out over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>In comparison to the North Face Terra 65 that Erik picked up it seems MUCH larger. Honestly, this bag felt like I was putting on my turtle shell every morning. It was comfy and fit perfectly! I have no complaints so far.</p>
